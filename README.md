# RFID Indoor Navigation for 2 wheeled Robot

## Installation

Any 2 wheeled robot should work.
You need a MFC522 reader, and some tags
Tested on a Arduino MEGA 2560 (may work with a UNO)
I'll be documenting this project in a few days on instructables

## Libraries

Because the Arduino IDE has been getting pretty bad handling libraries, I've included the libraries used in the src directory of the sketch. These libraries may have been slightly modified to work from the sketch directory, and do not include the examples.  

## Things To Do

Still a work in progress would like to:
add ablitiy for the Robot to figure out which direction it's facing at the start.
smooth out the forward motion.
a better way to do 90 degree turns.
